The content might differ slightly, but the format should look the same. A README is like a cover page to your GitHub repo and can be seen by anyone who looks at your GitHub projects. Therefore, it's important to take the time to create a well-written README for each project—especially if you want to showcase your work to future employers. As you work on projects throughout the boot camp, you will get plenty of experience writing effective README files.

Let’s sync our GitHub repo with our current work. You've done this several times already, so try to remember the Git commands on your own for the following steps:

Add and commit your files, and make sure to include a commit message!

Pull in the base branch, main.

Push up your feature branch.

HINT
Good job! Now let's merge the feature branch into our main branch and close the GitHub issue by following these steps:

In your browser, navigate to the project repo in GitHub and refresh to see the changes.

Select the "Compare & pull request" button. Remember, GitHub will know if a push to the repo has been made recently and offers this selection for any new branch that was recently pushed up.

Double-check that the base branch is the main branch and the comparison branch is feature/project-README. Enter the name of the PR and a brief description of what changes this PR will introduce. Select the "Create pull request" button to create a new pull request.

Now open the PR we created and merge the comparison branch into the base branch by clicking the "Merge pull request" button. When prompted, confirm the merge request.

Next, go the the main branch in GitHub and verify that the changes to the README file have been made, as shown in the following image:
